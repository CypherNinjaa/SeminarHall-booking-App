## 🔄 **ONE REMAINING ISSUE**

### Foreign Key Relationship Error

**Issue**: When admin tries to approve/reject bookings, this error occurs:

```
Could not find a relationship between 'smart_bookings' and 'user_id' in the schema cache
```

**Root Cause**: Missing foreign key constraint in database schema

**Impact**: Booking status updates fail, but everything else works perfectly

## 🚀 **IMMEDIATE SOLUTIONS**

### Option 1: Manual Database Fix (Recommended)

Apply this SQL command in your Supabase dashboard SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Add missing foreign key constraint
ALTER TABLE public.smart_bookings
ADD CONSTRAINT smart_bookings_user_id_fkey
FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES public.profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
```

### Option 2: Code Workaround (Temporary)

The booking service can be modified to handle this gracefully by fetching data separately.
