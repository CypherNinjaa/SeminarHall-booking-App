# ðŸ”§ Service Role Client Error - FIXED âœ…

## Issue Resolution Summary

**Error**: `Service role client not initialized. Call setupServiceClient first.`

**Root Cause**: The app was trying to use Supabase service role client directly in the React Native frontend, which is insecure and not supported.

## âœ… Complete Solution Implemented

### 1. Edge Function for Auth Operations

Created `supabase/functions/admin-auth-operations/index.ts`:

- Handles operations requiring service role access (auth user creation/deletion)
- Verifies super_admin permissions before operations
- Securely uses service role key in server environment
- Integrates with database RPC functions for profile management

### 2. Updated User Management Service

- `deleteUser()` now calls Edge Function for complete user deletion
- `createUser()` now calls Edge Function for auth user creation
- `updateUser()` continues to use RPC functions for profile updates
- Proper error handling and user feedback

### 3. Database RPC Functions

Enhanced `database/admin_functions.sql`:

- `admin_delete_user()` handles profile and related data deletion
- `admin_update_user()` handles profile updates
- `admin_create_user()` creates profile (used by Edge Function)
- All functions verify super_admin permissions

### 4. Deployment Infrastructure

- Created `supabase/functions/_shared/cors.ts` for CORS handling
- Added comprehensive deployment guide
- Environment variable configuration
- Testing and troubleshooting instructions

## ðŸ”’ Security Improvements

- âœ… Service role key secure in Edge Function environment only
- âœ… No sensitive keys exposed in client code
- âœ… All admin operations validated server-side
- âœ… Super admin permissions checked in both Edge Function and database
- âœ… Activity logging handled securely
- âœ… Proper error handling and user feedback

## ðŸ“‹ Deployment Required

**Critical**: You need to deploy the Edge Function to your Supabase project:

### Quick Setup:

1. Install Supabase CLI: `npm install -g supabase`
2. Login: `supabase login`
3. Link project: `supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_ID`
4. Deploy function: `supabase functions deploy admin-auth-operations`
5. Set environment variables in Supabase Dashboard
6. Run the SQL functions from `database/admin_functions.sql`

### Detailed Setup:

See `EDGE_FUNCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md` for complete instructions.

## ðŸ§ª Testing

After deployment, test these operations in the Super Admin screen:

- âœ… **Delete User**: Should completely remove user from both `profiles` and `auth.users`
- âœ… **Create User**: Should create both profile and auth user (if implemented)
- âœ… **Edit User**: Should update user information properly
- âœ… **Toggle Active Status**: Should continue to work
- âœ… **Role Changes**: Should work through RPC functions

## ðŸŽ¯ Technical Architecture

```

                â†“
              auth.users (Edge Function with service role)

              profiles + related data (RPC functions)
```
