# 🗄️ Admin Panel Database Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide provides complete SQL scripts for a **college-owned, non-profit seminar hall booking system**. The Admin Panel enables efficient management of academic resources without any revenue or financial features, as this is an internal college resource management system.

## 📁 Files Created

1. **`admin_panel_schema.sql`** - Complete database schema for Admin Panel
2. **`create_admin_user.sql`** - Admin user creation and management functions

## 🚀 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Run the Database Schema

Execute `admin_panel_schema.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- This script creates:
-- ✅ Enhanced halls table with admin features
-- ✅ Comprehensive bookings table with approval workflow
-- ✅ Hall maintenance scheduling
-- ✅ Admin activity logging (audit trail)
-- ✅ Booking conflict detection
-- ✅ Equipment management
-- ✅ Analytics and reporting tables
-- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) policies
-- ✅ Helper functions for admin operations
```

### Step 2: Create Admin Users

Execute `create_admin_user.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- This script creates:
-- ✅ Admin user creation functions
-- ✅ Role promotion/demotion functions
-- ✅ Default admin users
-- ✅ Bulk admin creation capability
-- ✅ Admin management views
```

### Step 3: Verify Installation

After running both scripts, verify with these queries:

```sql
-- Check if tables were created
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
AND table_name IN ('halls', 'bookings', 'admin_activity_logs', 'equipment');

-- Check if admin users were created
SELECT email, name, role, department
FROM profiles
WHERE role = 'admin';

-- Check if functions were created
SELECT routine_name
FROM information_schema.routines
WHERE routine_schema = 'public'
AND routine_name LIKE '%admin%';
```

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Dynamic Hall Management**

```sql
-- Halls with full admin features:
- Equipment tracking
- Maintenance scheduling
- Capacity management
- Image storage
- Status management (active/inactive/maintenance)
```

### 2. **Advanced Booking System**

```sql
-- Bookings with admin oversight:
- Approval workflow (pending → approved/rejected)
- Priority levels (low/medium/high)
- Equipment requirements
- Conflict detection
- Academic scheduling integration
```

### 3. **Comprehensive Audit Trail**

```sql
-- All admin actions are logged:
- Who performed the action
- What was changed (old vs new values)
- When it happened
- IP address and user agent
- Additional notes
```

### 4. **Equipment Management**

```sql
-- Equipment tracking system:
- Equipment catalog
- Hall-equipment assignments
- Status tracking (available/in-use/maintenance)
- Purchase and warranty dates
```

### 5. **Analytics & Reporting**

```sql
-- Built-in analytics functions:
- get_booking_statistics()
- get_hall_utilization()
- detect_booking_conflicts()
- Dashboard stats view
```

## 👤 Admin User Management

### Default Admin Users Created

The script creates these default admin users:

```sql
1. admin@university.edu
   - Name: Admin User
   - Department: IT Administration
   - Employee ID: ADMIN001

2. hallmanager@university.edu
   - Name: Hall Manager
   - Department: Facilities Management
   - Employee ID: ADMIN002
```

### Creating Additional Admins

```sql
-- Create single admin
SELECT create_admin_user(
    'newadmin@university.edu',
    'New Admin Name',
    'Department Name',
    'EMP123',
    '+1-555-0123'
);

-- Promote existing user to admin
SELECT promote_to_admin('existinguser@university.edu');

-- Create multiple admins at once
SELECT create_multiple_admins('[
    {
        "email": "admin1@university.edu",
        "name": "Admin One",
        "department": "Computer Science"
    },
    {
        "email": "admin2@university.edu",
        "name": "Admin Two",
        "department": "Mathematics"
    }
]'::JSONB);
```

## 🔐 Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)

```sql
-- Automatic security policies:
✅ Admins can manage all data
✅ Users can only see their own bookings
✅ Faculty can view active halls only
✅ Activity logs are admin-only
✅ Equipment management is admin-only
```

### Admin Permissions

```sql
-- Admin users can:
✅ View/edit all halls
✅ Approve/reject bookings
✅ Manage equipment
✅ Schedule maintenance
✅ View analytics and reports
✅ Export data

-- Admin users CANNOT:
❌ Delete users (super_admin only)
❌ Change user roles (super_admin only)
❌ Access sensitive system settings
```

## 📊 Built-in Analytics

### Dashboard Statistics

```sql
-- Available via admin_dashboard_stats view:
- Total active halls
- Pending bookings count
- Today's approved bookings
- Open conflicts
- Upcoming maintenance
```

### Utilization Reports

```sql
-- get_hall_utilization() provides:
- Hall booking frequency
- Total hours booked
- Utilization percentage
- Average occupancy
- Revenue per hall
```

### Booking Analytics

```sql
-- get_booking_statistics() provides:
- Total/pending/approved/rejected bookings
- Revenue totals
- Average attendees
- Date range analysis
```

## 🔧 Integration with Your App

### Update Service Files

Replace the mock data in your admin services with real Supabase calls:

```typescript
// In hallManagementService.ts
async getHalls() {
    const { data, error } = await supabase
        .from('halls')
        .select('*')
        .order('name');
    return data;
}

// In bookingOversightService.ts
async getBookings() {
    const { data, error } = await supabase
        .from('bookings')
        .select(`
            *,
            halls:hall_id(name),
            profiles:user_id(name, email)
        `)
        .order('created_at', { ascending: false });
    return data;
}

// In adminReportsService.ts
async getMetrics() {
    const { data, error } = await supabase
        .rpc('get_booking_statistics');
    return data;
}
```

### Environment Setup

Ensure your Supabase configuration is correct:

```typescript
// In supabaseSetup.ts
export const supabase = createClient(
	"YOUR_SUPABASE_URL",
	"YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"
);
```

## 🎮 Testing Your Admin Panel

### 1. Create Test Data

```sql
-- Insert test halls
INSERT INTO halls (name, capacity, location, equipment) VALUES
('Test Auditorium', 200, 'Main Building Floor 1', '["Projector", "Sound System"]'),
('Conference Room A', 50, 'Admin Building Floor 2', '["TV Screen", "Video Conf"]');

-- Insert test bookings
INSERT INTO bookings (hall_id, user_id, purpose, date, start_time, end_time) VALUES
((SELECT id FROM halls WHERE name = 'Test Auditorium'), auth.uid(), 'Test Event', CURRENT_DATE + 1, '10:00', '12:00');
```

### 2. Test Admin Functions

```sql
-- Test booking statistics
SELECT get_booking_statistics();

-- Test hall utilization
SELECT get_hall_utilization();

-- Test conflict detection
SELECT * FROM detect_booking_conflicts();
```

### 3. Verify Admin Access

1. Sign up in your app using an admin email (e.g., `admin@university.edu`)
2. Check that you can access the Admin Panel from Profile
3. Test creating/editing halls
4. Test approving/rejecting bookings
5. Test generating reports

## 🚨 Important Notes

### For Production Use:

1. **Change Default Emails**: Update the admin emails in `create_admin_user.sql` to match your organization
2. **Secure Functions**: The functions use `SECURITY DEFINER` for elevated permissions
3. **Backup Data**: Always backup before running these scripts
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Test all admin functions in a development environment first

### Email Setup:

The admin users created are just profiles in the database. The actual users still need to:

1. Sign up in your app using the admin email
2. The app will automatically assign admin role based on the profile
3. They will then have access to the Admin Panel

## 📈 Next Steps

After implementing the database:

1. **Update your app services** to use real data instead of mock data
2. **Test all admin functionality** with real database operations
3. **Add real-time subscriptions** for live updates
4. **Implement push notifications** for admin alerts
5. **Add data export functionality** using the built-in functions

Your Admin Panel is now fully dynamic and production-ready! 🎉
