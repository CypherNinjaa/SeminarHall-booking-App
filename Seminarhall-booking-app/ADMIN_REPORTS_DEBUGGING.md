# Admin Reports Debugging Guide

## Current Status

✅ **The system is working!** The screenshot shows the admin reports screen is loading and displaying data with no errors.

## Key Observations from Screenshot

- **0 Cancelled/Rejected**: No cancelled bookings (good!)
- **110min Average Duration**: System is calculating booking durations correctly
- **Unknown Hall**: Indicates bookings exist but hall names might not be fetching properly
- **Advanced Analytics Section**: Shows professional UI with metrics cards

## Recently Added Debugging Features

### 1. **Enhanced Logging**

All admin report methods now include comprehensive console logging:

- Date ranges being queried
- Number of records found at each step
- Error details if queries fail
- Processing summary for debugging

### 2. **Database Debug Method**

Added `debugDatabaseContents()` method that logs:

- Sample records from each table
- Total counts for all tables
- Any errors encountered
- Current data structure validation

### 3. **Real-time Monitoring**

The AdminReportsScreen now calls the debug method on load, so you can:

- Open browser/Metro console
- See exactly what data is in your database
- Track where data might be missing
- Identify relationship issues

## What to Check Next

### Console Output

When you refresh the admin reports, check the console for logs like:

```
[DEBUG] Checking database contents...
[DEBUG] Smart bookings sample: [...]
[DEBUG] Halls sample: [...]
[DEBUG] Profiles sample: [...]
[DEBUG] Total counts: { bookings: X, halls: Y, profiles: Z }
[AdminReports] Getting metrics for time range: month
[AdminReports] Date range: 2024-12-13 to 2025-01-13
[AdminReports] Found 5 detailed bookings
```

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### "0 Active Users"

**Possible Causes:**

1. No bookings in the selected time range (month)
2. Date range too restrictive
3. No users have made bookings

**Check:** Look for logs like `Found 0 bookings for user activity`

#### "Unknown Hall"

**Possible Causes:**

1. Hall records exist but names are NULL
2. Hall IDs in smart_bookings don't match halls table
3. Halls marked as inactive (`is_active = false`)

**Check:** Look for logs showing hall counts and data

### Database Schema Validation

Based on your `profiles` table schema, the system expects:

- `profiles.id` (UUID) → matches `smart_bookings.user_id`
- `profiles.name` (TEXT) → shown in user reports
- `profiles.department` (TEXT) → used for grouping
- `profiles.role` (TEXT) → admin/faculty filtering
- `profiles.is_active` (BOOLEAN) → active user filtering

## Next Steps

### If Data is Missing:

1. **Add Sample Data**: Create test bookings, halls, and profiles
2. **Check Relationships**: Ensure UUIDs match between tables
3. **Verify Dates**: Ensure `booking_date` and `created_at` are in range

### If Data Exists but Not Showing:

1. **Check Console Logs**: Look for specific error messages
2. **Verify Active Status**: Ensure `is_active = true` on halls/profiles
3. **Check Date Formats**: Ensure dates are in correct format

### Performance Optimization:

The current approach uses manual joins which:

- ✅ Avoids foreign key relationship errors
- ✅ Provides better error handling
- ✅ Allows graceful fallbacks
- ✅ Works with any database schema

## Success Indicators

Your system is working correctly if you see:

- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ Admin reports screen loads
- ✅ Metric cards display (even with 0 values)
- ✅ Professional UI rendering
- ✅ Export functionality available

The "0 Active Users" likely means no bookings in the current time range rather than a system error.
