# Forgot Password Implementation Guide

## Overview

The forgot password feature allows users to reset their password by receiving a reset link via email. This implementation integrates with your website's comprehensive email system and uses Supabase Auth for password updates.

## User Flow

### 1. Forgot Password Request

1. User navigates to Login screen
2. User clicks "Forgot your password?" link
3. User is taken to ForgotPasswordScreen
4. User enters their email address
5. User clicks "Send Reset Link"
6. System sends password reset email via your website's email API
7. User sees confirmation message

### 2. Password Reset

1. User receives email with reset link
2. User clicks the reset link in email
3. Link opens the app and navigates to ResetPasswordScreen
4. User enters new password and confirms it
5. User clicks "Update Password"
6. Password is updated via Supabase Auth
7. User is redirected to Login screen

### Configuration

#### Environment-Specific Redirect URLs

- **Development**: `exp://localhost:8081/--/reset-password`
- **Production**: `seminarhallbooking://reset-password`

#### Deep Linking Setup

The app is configured to handle reset password links via:

- Custom URL scheme: `seminarhallbooking://`
- Expo development URLs: `exp://localhost:8081/--/`

### Supabase Configuration Required

#### Email Templates (Optional)

You can customize the password reset email template in Supabase Dashboard:

1. Go to Authentication > Email Templates
2. Edit "Reset Password" template
3. Customize branding and messaging

#### URL Configuration

Ensure the redirect URLs are configured in your Supabase project:

1. Go to Authentication > URL Configuration
2. Add your redirect URLs to the "Redirect URLs" list

## Testing the Feature

### Development Testing

1. Start the Expo development server
2. Navigate to Login screen in app
3. Click "Forgot your password?"
4. Enter a valid email address
5. Check email for reset link
6. Click reset link to test deep linking
7. Complete password reset flow

### Production Testing

1. Build and deploy the app
2. Test with real email addresses
3. Verify deep linking works with production URL scheme

## Error Handling

### Common Error Scenarios

- Invalid email address format
- Email not found in system
- Network connectivity issues
- Expired reset token
- Password validation failures

### User-Friendly Messages

- All error messages are designed to be helpful but not reveal sensitive information
- Generic error messages for security (e.g., "Please verify your email address")
- Clear validation feedback for password requirements

## Security Considerations

### Best Practices Implemented

- No password reset tokens stored in app
- Server-side validation through Supabase
- Automatic token expiration
- Rate limiting (handled by Supabase)
- Secure email delivery

### Additional Security Measures

- Consider implementing rate limiting on client side
- Log password reset requests for admin monitoring
- Monitor for suspicious password reset patterns

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

- SMS-based password reset option
- Two-factor authentication integration
- Account lockout after multiple failed attempts
- Password history to prevent reuse
- Custom email templates with university branding

### Analytics

- Track password reset completion rates
- Monitor common user issues
- Measure email delivery success rates

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Deep linking not working**: Check URL scheme configuration in app.json
2. **Emails not received**: Verify Supabase email settings and spam folders
3. **Reset link expired**: Links expire after 1 hour, request new reset
4. **App not opening from email**: Ensure app is installed and URL scheme is registered

### Debug Steps

1. Check Supabase Auth logs for email delivery status
2. Verify redirect URLs are properly configured
3. Test deep linking with manual URL navigation
4. Check console logs for error messages
