## 🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

The foreign key relationship errors you're seeing can be fixed by running one SQL script in Supabase.

### Step 1: Run Database Fix Script

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard** → Your Project → SQL Editor

### Step 3: Test Admin Panel

1. **Open the app** and sign up/login
2. **Go to Profile → Admin Panel**

### Step 4: Verify No More Errors

The console should **no longer show:**

```
