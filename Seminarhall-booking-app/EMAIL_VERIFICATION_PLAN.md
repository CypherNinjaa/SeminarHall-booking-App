# Email Verification System Implementation

## Current Issue
The email verification links from Supabase are redirecting to your website but showing "Email link is invalid or has expired" errors.

## Comprehensive Solution

### 1. Supabase Email Settings Configuration

First, update your Supabase project settings:

**In Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → URL Configuration:**

```
Site URL: https://seminarhall-ivory.vercel.app
Redirect URLs: 
- https://seminarhall-ivory.vercel.app/auth/callback
- exp://192.168.1.100:19000/--/auth/callback (for development)
- yourapp://auth/callback (for production mobile app)
```

### 2. Email Template Customization

**In Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Email Templates:**

Update the "Confirm signup" template:

```html
<h2>Welcome to Amity University Patna Seminar Hall Booking</h2>
<p>Thank you for signing up! Please click the link below to verify your email address:</p>
<p><a href="{{ .ConfirmationURL }}">Verify Email Address</a></p>
<p>This link will expire in 24 hours.</p>
<p>If you didn't create an account, you can safely ignore this email.</p>
```

### 3. Website Callback Handler

Create a dedicated email verification page for your website that:

1. **Handles the callback** from Supabase
2. **Processes the verification** 
3. **Shows success/error states**
4. **Provides mobile app download links**

### 4. React Native Deep Linking

Set up deep linking in your React Native app to handle email verification directly in the mobile app.

### 5. Automatic User Activation

Create a database function that automatically activates users when they verify their email.

## Implementation Files

I'll create the following files for you:

1. **Email verification callback page** (for website)
2. **Deep linking configuration** (for React Native)
3. **Database functions** for automatic activation
4. **Updated registration flow** with proper email verification

Would you like me to:

1. **Create the website callback handler** first?
2. **Set up deep linking** in the React Native app?
3. **Create the automatic activation system**?
4. **All of the above**?

## Quick Fix Options

### Option A: Disable Email Verification (Quick)
```sql
-- Disable email confirmation requirement
UPDATE auth.users SET email_confirmed_at = NOW() WHERE email_confirmed_at IS NULL;
```

### Option B: Implement Full Email Verification System (Recommended)
- Website callback handler
- Mobile deep linking  
- Automatic user activation
- Better user experience
