# Email Verification Setup Summary

## Overview

The app now has complete email verification functionality integrated with your website. Here's how it works:

## Signup Flow

### 1. User Registration

- User fills out signup form in mobile app
- App calls Supabase `signUp()` with email verification enabled
- Supabase sends verification email to user with link to your website
- Success message: _"Your account has been created! Please check your email and click the verification link before logging in. After verification, wait for admin approval to access the app."_

### 2. Email Verification (Website)

- User receives email with verification link
- Link opens your website at: `https://seminarhall-ivory.vercel.app/email-verification`
- User completes verification on website
- Website redirects back to app: `seminarhallbooking://auth/email-verified`
- App opens and navigates to main screen (for verified users)

## Login Flow

### 1. Login Attempt

- User enters email/password in mobile app
- App checks authentication with Supabase

### 2. Email Verification Check

- If email is NOT verified: Login fails with message: _"Please verify your email address before logging in. Check your email for the verification link."_
- If email IS verified: Login proceeds normally (subject to admin approval)

## Technical Implementation

### Auth Store (`authStore.ts`)

```typescript
// Login function checks email verification
if (!authData.user.email_confirmed_at) {
	await supabase.auth.signOut();
	throw new Error(
		"Please verify your email address before logging in. Check your email for the verification link."
	);
}

// Register function sends verification email
const { data: authData, error: authError } = await supabase.auth.signUp({
	email: userData.email!,
	password: userData.password,
	options: {
		emailRedirectTo: "https://seminarhall-ivory.vercel.app/email-verification",
	},
});
```

### Signup Screen (`SignupScreen.tsx`)

- Updated success message to mention email verification requirement
- Guides users to check email before attempting login

### Login Screen (`LoginScreen.tsx`)

- Shows specific error messages including email verification errors
- Displays auth store error messages directly to user

## Website Requirements

Your website at `https://seminarhall-ivory.vercel.app/email-verification` should:

1. **Handle email verification** using Supabase JavaScript client
2. **Show success message** after verification
3. **Redirect to app** after 3 seconds:
   ```javascript
   setTimeout(() => {
   	window.location.href = "seminarhallbooking://auth/email-verified";
   }, 3000);
   ```

## Supabase Configuration

Make sure these URLs are added to your Supabase project:

### Authentication > URL Configuration:

- **Site URL**: `https://seminarhall-ivory.vercel.app`
- **Redirect URLs**:
  - `https://seminarhall-ivory.vercel.app/email-verification`
  - `https://seminarhall-ivory.vercel.app/forgot-password`

## User Experience Flow

1. **Registration**: User signs up → receives verification email
2. **Verification**: User clicks email link → verifies on website → redirected to app
3. **Login**: User tries to login → email verification checked → proceeds if verified
4. **Admin Approval**: After email verification, user still needs admin approval to access features

## Error Handling

- **Unverified login attempt**: Clear error message with guidance
- **Failed verification**: Website handles and shows appropriate messages
- **Network issues**: Proper error messages and retry options

## Benefits

- ✅ Secure email verification using Supabase built-in system
- ✅ Seamless integration between mobile app and website
- ✅ Clear user guidance at each step
- ✅ Proper error handling and messaging
- ✅ No duplicate verification screens in mobile app
- ✅ Leverages existing website infrastructure

## Testing Checklist

1. ✅ Register new user → receives verification email
2. ✅ Try login before verification → shows error message
3. ✅ Verify email on website → redirects to app
4. ✅ Login after verification → proceeds normally
5. ✅ Test error scenarios and edge cases
