# Smart Bookings Migration Summary

## Overview

Successfully updated the AdminReportsScreen and adminReportsService to use the `smart_bookings` table instead of the legacy `bookings` table.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Updated DetailedBooking Interface

- Added smart_bookings specific fields:
  - `duration_minutes`: Booking duration in minutes
  - `buffer_start` & `buffer_end`: Buffer times for setup/cleanup
  - `description`: Additional booking description
  - `priority`: Booking priority (low, medium, high)
  - `auto_approved`: Whether booking was automatically approved
  - `rejected_reason`: Reason for rejection
  - `admin_notes`: Administrative notes
- Changed `equipment_requested` to `equipment_needed` to match schema
- Updated status enum to include 'approved' and 'rejected' instead of 'confirmed'

### 2. Updated Database Queries

All queries now use `smart_bookings` table:

- `getTotalBookings()`: Updated to query smart_bookings
- `getUtilizationRate()`: Now uses actual duration_minutes for accurate calculations
- `getPopularHalls()`: Uses smart_bookings with proper duration tracking
- `getBookingTrends()`: Updated to smart_bookings table
- `getUserActivity()`: Now tracks actual booking duration from smart_bookings
- `getDetailedBookings()`: Complete rewrite to use smart_bookings schema with all new fields

### 3. Enhanced Data Analytics

- **Duration Calculations**: Now uses actual `duration_minutes` instead of estimates
- **Buffer Times**: Includes buffer_start and buffer_end for complete scheduling picture
- **Priority Tracking**: Shows booking priority levels
- **Auto-approval Status**: Tracks which bookings were auto-approved
- **Admin Notes**: Includes administrative comments and notes
- **Equipment Tracking**: Uses `equipment_needed` array from smart_bookings

### 4. Smart Bookings Schema Fields Included

```sql
- id (booking_id)
- user_id, hall_id
- booking_date, start_time, end_time
- duration_minutes (primary duration field)
